** Project-2 Data collecting and storage **

We want to create an index that demonstrates how developed a country is in terms of scientific research. 

This index will combine both indicators showing support for R&D and the outcomes of that R&D to create a broader measure of development.

The indicators that we will look at are the following:

**Inputs:**

	> - Research and development expenditure (% of GDP)

	> -  Implied tax subsidy rates on R&D expenditures

**Outcomes:**

	> -  Researchers in R&D (per million people)

	> -  Scientific and technical journal articles (per 1000 people)

 

**Assumptions:**

*We are assuming that a large proportion of R&D is going towards scientific-based projects.

 

**Limitations:**

Not every country provides data for these indicators

Data is not available for every year

There are not many indicators directly linked to science. We have to take a broader R&D measure.
